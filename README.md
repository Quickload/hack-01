## It's not about the money
We have received many responses from the community and you have been selected based on your experience and personality.

The base compensation will be the same for everyone $1,500 for the 24 hours of worth of work, this is about $60/hr.

The goal for this initiative is not only to make money, but most importantly, to have fun and work with other top professionals that have the same passion for technology you have.

We are planning on doing more of this in the near future.
